<b><i>Dear Ultracentrifugation User!</b></i>
</font>
<p>
Welcome to the <b><i>UltraScan</i></b> website. Here you can find all the
links for downloading the <i><b>UltraScan</i></b> software, installation instructions, 
FAQs, documentation and manuals, as well as links to related information.
<p>
<b>Description:</b><p>
<i><b>UltraScan</i></b> represents a comprehensive data analysis software
package for hydrodynamic data from analytical ultracentrifugation
experiments. The software features an integrated data editing and analysis
environment with a portable graphical user interface. A Beowulf module
for Monte Carlo analysis is also built in, and a MySQL database backend is
integrated for data management.  Special care has been taken in the design
of the software to guarantee an optimum in flexibility, user-friendliness,
stability and convenience. The software is written in C++.

<p>
The software features popular sedimentation velocity and equilibrium analysis
methods as well as simulation modules, utilities, and editing modules with
support for velocity and equilibrium experiments, single and multi-channel
centerpieces, absorbance and interference optics. All analysis methods
generate ASCII formatted data suitable for import into third-party
plotting programs, and contains a built-in postscript printer engine to
generate publication - quality graphical representations of analysis data.
