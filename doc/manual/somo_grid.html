<p>

This module controls the parameter of the <b>Build AtoB (Grid) Bead Model </b> routine, which is still under development at this stage. Currently, a basic mode is implemented, in which the cubic grid is applied, beads are generated and labeled <b>all</b> as
being buried, and the overlaps are all removed in one pass. The ASA re-check routine <b>must</b> be active to properly classify
the beads as being exposed or buried following overlap removal. This step is controlled by its own parameter, see <a href=somo_asa.html>here</a>.
<p>
In the <i>Computations Relative to:</i> section, the user selects if the coordinates of each bead built by the grid routine have to be placed in the <b>Center of Mass (default)</b> between all atoms whose centers fall within the cubelet, or in the <b>Center of Cubelet</b>. These options are obviously mutually exclusive.
<p>
The <i>Cube Side (Angstrom):</i> field determines the dimension of the grid cubelets (<b>default: 5 A</b>).
<p>
The next three independently selectable options controls other steps or features of the grid-based method:
<p>
<i>Apply Cubic Grid</i> allows the grid procedure to be executed (<b>deafult: active</b>). It could be deselected to allow the use of the Grid module for overlap removal of a previously loaded bead model.
<p>
<i>Hydrate the Original Model</i>. This routine is <b>not</b> available yet. It was developed by Marcelo Nollmann for his revision of the original AtoB program. More explanations will be provided once the routine will be fully implemented and tested.
<p>
Likewise, the <i>Expand Bead to Tangency</i> routine has not been fully implemented at this stage. The idea behind this procedure was to cope with the voids sometimes generated between beads by the Grid approach. More explanations will be provided once the routine will be fully implemented and tested.
<p>
Finally, the <b>Adjust Overlap Options</b> button will activate the <b>Grid beads</b> tab in the
 <a href=somo_overlap.html><b>Bead Overlap Reduction Options</b></a> module, allowing the setting of the 
various parameters governing the execution of the overlap removal routines. (<b>default: active</b>).
