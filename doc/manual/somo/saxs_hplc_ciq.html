<p>

This pop-up panel will appear when the <b><i>Make I(q)</i></b> button is pressed in the main <b><i>HPLC-SAXS</i></b> module. If a baseline was established and subtracted, each produced dataset will be marked with "bs" to indicate that. Since a non-zero baseline is usually due to spurious signals, such as the accumulation of material on the capillary walls during a chromatographic separation, baseline back-addition should not be done, and therefore it's not allowed in non-expert mode operation. The baselines are only added to the sums of Gaussians to verify that the original <i>I(q)</i> vs. <i>q</i> frames have been correctly reconstructed (see below).<p>

Three options are present in this panel:<p>

<ul>
<li>
The first checkbox <i>Resulting I(q) created as a percent of the original I(q) (if unchecked, I(q) will be created from the Gaussians)</i>  controls the produced <i>I(q)</i> vs. <i>q</i> data for each Gaussian point in each frame: they can be saved as the actual Gaussian value, or as a % of the original data point based on each Gaussian contribution to the fit (<b>default option</b>). The first option (checkbox unchecked) produces smoothed <i>I(q)</i> vs. <i>q</i> curves, while the second (checked) preserves the irregularities present in the original data.<p>

<li>
The second checkbox <i>Create sum of peak curves</i> allows to check that the individual Gaussian will add back up reconstructing the original <i>I(q)</i> vs. <i>q</i> curves. If checked, their point-wise sum can also be saved, as either <i>sum(I)</i> (reconstructed values) and <i>sum(G)</i> (pure Gaussians) curves. If <i>linear</i> baselines were established and subtracted, two sums will be produced, without and with baseline back-addition (default: <b>unchecked</b>).(<i>Integral</i> baseline add-back is not currently available).<p>

<li>
<i>Compute standard deviations as a difference between the sum of Gaussians and original I(q)</i>. In all cases, the original errors associated with each <i>I(q)</i> vs. <i>q</i> point in each frame will assigned %-wise to each point in the resulting decomposed <i>I(q)</i> vs. <i>q</i> curves for each frame <span style="color:#CC0000">(Note: a full re-evaluation of the SD treatment is pending as of May 2014)</span>. Alternatively, if this checkbox is checked, and only if the % of the original data are chosen for saving, a new set of errors can be computed, and assigned %-wise to each point in the decomposed <i>I(q)</i> vs. <i>q</i> curves, by point-wise calculating the difference between the sum of the Gaussians (with baseline added) and the original curve (default: <b>unchecked</b>).<p>
</ul>

If some of the <i>I(t)</i> data have zero SD, an additional line will be present in this panel, as shown above.<p>

The extra line reads <i>I(t) contains S.D.'s of zeros. When computing I(q) S.D.'s:</i> and then offers three options:<p>

<ul>
<li>
<i>Drop points</i>. The data with zero SD will be removed;<p>
<li>
<i>Average adjacent S.D.'s</i>. An average between the SD of the previous and following datapoint will be made and assigned to the data point in question (<b>default option</b>).<p>
<li>
<i>Leave as zeros</i>. The corresponding <i>I(q)</i> points will have zero SD.<p>
</ul>

A fourth option is then presented:<p>

<i>I0 standard experimental value (a.u.):</i>. A normalization factor from a standard sample to be associated with the data can be also entered here. If this checkbox is checked, its value will be associated in each resulting <i>I(q)</i> vs. <i>q</i> curve (default: <b>unchecked</b>).<p>

Finally, if a concentration chromatogram has also been processed a calculated concentration can be assigned to each of the resulting <i>I(q)</i> vs. <i>q</i> curves. This is done by entering an extinction coefficient (or a <i>dn/dc</i>) for each Gaussian. In addition, a partial specific volume (<i>psv</i>) value, needed for the computation of the <<i>M</i>><i><sub>w</sub></i>, <<i>M</i>&#47;<i>L</i>><i><sub>w/z</sub></i>, and <<i>M</i>&#47;<i>A</i>><i><sub>w/z</sub></i> by Guinier analysis in the main <b>US-SOMO <i>SAS module</i></b>, can be also entered here. The module will present as many fields as the Gaussians used to decomposed the data. If all the Gaussians represent a species with the same extinction coefficient (or <i>dn/dc</i>) and <i>psv</i>, the values need to be entered only once in the 1st Gaussian fields, and then they can be propagated to all the other fields by pressing the <b><i>Duplicate Gaussian 1 values globally</i></b> button. The concentration value will be used when the <b><i>Normalize</b></i> button in the main <b>HPLC-SAXS</b> module is pressed after dataset selection.<p>

It is also possible to back-generate an <i>I(q)</i> vs. <i>q</i> set without using the Gaussian decomposition by pressing the <b><i>Make I(q) without Gaussians</i></b> button.<p>

For normal operation, once all fields/checkboxes have been properly set, pressing <b><i>Continue</i></b> will return to the main <b><i>HPLC-SAXS</i></b> window and start the make <i>I(q)</i> process.
