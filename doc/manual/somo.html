SOMO - Solution Modeler (Bead Modeler for NMR and X-ray structures):</h2>
</center>
<p>
The SOMO (SOlution MOdeller) module of UltraScan is a bead modelling
utility that was originally developed by the Rocco and Byron labs,
respectively at the Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro (IST,
Genova, Italy) and at the University of Glasgow (Glasgow, Scotland,
UK). The original code was mainly written by B. Spotorno, G. Tassara,
N. Rai and M. Nollmann. SOMO is based on a reduced representation of
a biomacromolecule, starting from its atomic coordinates (PDB format), as a set of
non-overlapping beads of different radii, from which the hydrodynamic
properties can be calculated using the Garcia de la Torre-Bloomfield rigid-body
approach (García de la Torre and Bloomfield, Q. Rev. Biophys. 14:81-139,
1981). The reduced representation is afforded by grouping together atoms
and substituting them with a bead of the same volume, appropriately
positioned. Importantly, the volume of the water of hydration
theoretically bound to each group of atoms can be then added to each
bead. The overlaps between the beads are then removed in sequential
steps, but preserving as much as possible the original surface envelope
of the bead model. The method has been fully validated and reported in the
literature (Rai et al., Structure 13:723-734, 2005; Brookes et al., Eur. Biophys. J., 
in press, 2009). Among the main advantages of this method over shell-modelling
and grid-based procedures are a better treatment of the hydration water and the preservation of a
direct correspondence between beads and original residues. For instance,
the latter feature could be used to include flexibility effects into
the computations. Furthermore, by identifying and excluding from the
hydrodynamic computations beads that are buried and thus non in contact
with the solvent, a large span in the size of the structures that can
be analysed with this method without loss of precision is obtained:
currently, structures from 5K to 250K have been successfully studied.

<h3><b>General description:</b></h3>
<p>
<P>
The program main window contains an upper bar from which all the options
governing its operations can be controlled, and a main panel for program
execution. However, due to its high level of sophistication, properly setting all
the available options can be non-trivial for the general user. Therefore,
the SOMO module is distributed with pre-defined default options that should
allow the direct conversion of a PDB-formatted biomacromolecular structure
file into a bead model, and the computation of its hydrodynamic properties,
without the need of accessing the advanced options menus.
In particular, the SOMO approach is based on properly defining the atoms and
residues found in PDB files, and the rules allowing their conversion
into beads. The SOMO distribution includes the definition of all the standard
amino acids, nucleotides, carbohydrates, and common prosthetic groups and 
co-factors, but this list is by no means exhaustive, and the need to code for
"new" residues is not a remote possibility. As this operation can be demanding,
notwithstanding the user-friendly GUI governing it, the pre-defined set of options
include an approximate method to deal with either missing atoms within coded residues,
and/or not yet coded residues. However, be aware that for best performance, the structure
should contain all residues and atoms that are present in the "real" macromolecule
studied in solution, and all residues should be properly coded in the SOMO tables
(see below).

<p><b>Run SOMO Program:</b>
<p>
These functions control the execution of the SOMO program, whose progress is
recorded in the right-side main window. The first step is to select a lookup table
by clicking on <i><b>Select Lookup Table</b></i> (default: <i>somo.residue</i>).
You can create multiple lookup tables for different conditions. The lookup table
needs to contain all atoms and residues defined in your molecule to be loaded in
the next step. By default, SOMO will automatically load the last used <i>*.residue</i> table.
As soon as the lookup table has been successfully loaded, the <i><b>Load PDB File</b></i>
button will become active and you can load a PDB structure file from
NMR or X-ray crystallography experiments. Selecting a PBD file will also
automatically call the molecular visualization program <i>RasMol</i> (Sayle RA, Milner-
White EJ. RasMol: biomolecular graphics for all. Trends Biochem. Sci. 20:374-376,
1995) which will display the structure(s) in a pop-up window. <i>RasMol</i>
needs to be installed in <pre><b>$ULTRASCAN/bin</b></pre> for 32 bit
machines, and <pre><b>$ULTRASCAN/bin64</b></pre> for 64 bit platforms.
You can get a copy of <i>RasMol</i> from <a href="http://www.umass.edu/microbio/rasmol/">
http://www.umass.edu/microbio/rasmol/</a> or from <a href="http://openrasmol.org/#Software">
http://openrasmol.org/#Software</a>.<p>
The PDB file can contain multiple models and if so, multiple models will be displayed by
<i>RasMol</i> and in the list box. In this case, you can select just a single model,
or multiple models by holding the crtl key while clicking on the models' names (crtl-A selects
all models). If multiple models are selected, all subsequent operations
are carried out sequentially on the selected models. Once one or multiple
models are selected, the <i><b>Build SOMO Bead Model</b></i> and <i><b>Build
Grid Bead Model</b></i> buttons will become active, offering two alternative
ways of generating a bead model based on the settings selected
above. Once bead model(s) generation is completed, the progress bar will be at 100% and the bead model(s) can be visualized with <i>RasMol</i> by clicking on <i><b>Visualize Bead Model</b></i>.
The results of the acessible surface area (ASA) computations (see below) can also be visualized
in a pop-up window by clicking on the <i><b>Show ASA Results</b></i> button. Alternatively, you
can skip all of these steps and load a previously generated bead model by clicking on <i><b>Load
Bead Model File</b></i> from the menu. In this case, and if the model was generated/saved in the
SOMO format, the various settings/parameters used in model generation will be displayed in
the right-side main window. The hydrodynamic parameters can be then determined by clicking on <i><b>Calculate Hydrodynamics</b></i>. A partial list of parameters can be seen in
a pop-up window as soon as the calculations are completed by clicking on <a href=
"somo-results.png"><i><b>Show Hydrodynamic Calculations</b></i></a>. A full list of all the parameters is also available as a text file, which can be opened from the results' pop-up window. Operations can be halted at any moment by clicking on the <i><b>Stop</b></i> button. To avoid inadvertendly loosing data, the <i><b>Close</b></i> button will not immediately close SOMO, but confirmation will be required in a pop-up window.

From this pull-down menu, you can call three different sub-menus controlling
the three tables containing the definitions of the atoms and residues found in
PDB files.<br>
More in detail, you can define/edit the hybridizations, atoms and residues
that need to be interpreted as beads in the bead model generation.
These parameters are collected in different tables that are used 
as the components from which the bead sizes and positions are calculated.
PDB structures can then be converted to bead models based on the bead
parameters defined here.
<ul>
<li>
<b>Add/Edit Hybridization:</b> Use this function to modify the <a href=
"somo-1.png">hybridization table</a>. In this file you need to list all
hybridizations (as defined in Tsai et al., J. Mol. Biol. 290:253-266, 1999)
that will be used for the definitions of all atoms. Each hybridization
requires a name, a molecular weight (given by the sum of the mw of the 
atom being defined plus that of the hydrogen atoms bound to it) and a radius
(in Angstrom units). Load the hybridization file first if one exists, and
add new hybridizations to it by filling out the fields and clicking on
<b><i>"Add Hybridization to File"</i></b></li>
<li>
<b>Add/Edit Atom:</b> Use this function to modify the <a href=
"somo-2.png">atom table</a>. In this file you need to list all
atom details that will be used for the definitions of all residues. Each
atom requires a name, a hybridization, a molecular weight and a radius (in
Angstrom units). The latter two properties are automatically defined once
the proper hybrydization is chosen from the <a href="somo-1.png">hybridization
table</a>.

Load the hybridization file first, then the atom file if one exists, and
add new atoms to it by filling out the fields and clicking on
<b><i>Add Atom to File</i></b>. You can also delete an atom from
the file.</li>
<li>
<b>Add/Edit Residue:</b> Use this function to modify the <a href=
"somo-residue.png">residue table</a>. The use of this module is described in
<a href="somo_residue.html">this help file</a>.
