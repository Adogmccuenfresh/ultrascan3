The SOMO (SOlution MOdeller) module of UltraScan is a bead modelling
utility that was originally developed by the Rocco and Byron labs,
respectively at the Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro (IST,
Genova, Italy) and at the University of Glasgow (Glasgow, Scotland,
UK). The original code was mainly written by B. Spotorno, G. Tassara,
N. Rai and M. Nollmann. SOMO is based on a reduced representation of
a biomacromolecule, starting from its atomic coordinates, as a set of
non-overlapping beads of different radii, from which the hydrodynamic
properties can be calculated using the Garcia de la Torre-Bloomfield rigid-body
approach (García de la Torre and Bloomfield, Q. Rev. Biophys. 14:81-139,
1981). The reduced representation is afforded by grouping together atoms
and substituting them with a bead of the same volume, appropriately
positioned. Importantly, the volume of the water of hydration
theoretically bound to each group of atoms can be then added to each
bead. The overlaps between the beads are then removed in sequential
steps, but preserving as much as possible the original surface envelope
of the bead model. The method has been fully validated and reported in the
literature (Rai et al., Structure 13:723-734, 2005; Brookes et al., Eur. Biophys. J., 
in press, 2009). Among the main advantages of this method over shell-modelling
and grid-based procedures are a better treatment of the hydration water and the preservation of a
direct correspondence between beads and original residues. For instance,
the latter feature could be used to include flexibility effects into
the computations. Furthermore, by identifying and excluding from the
hydrodynamic computations beads that are buried and thus non in contact
with the solvent, a large span in the size of the structures that can
be analysed with this method without loss of precision is obtained:
currently, structures from 5K to 250K have been successfully studied.

In this section you can define the hybridizations, atoms and residues
that need to be interpreted as beads in the bead model generation.
These parameters are collected in different tables that are used 
as the components from which the bead sizes and positions are calculated.
PDB structures can then be converted to bead models based on the bead
parameters defined here.
<ul>
<li>
<b>Add/Edit Hybridization:</b> Use this function to modify the <a href=
"somo-1.png">hybridization table</a>. In this file you need to list all
hybridizations (as defined in Tsai et al., J. Mol. Biol. 290:253-266, 1999)
that will be used for the definitions of all atoms. Each hybridization
requires a name, a molecular weight (given by the sum of the mw of the 
atom being defined plus that of the hydrogen atoms bound to it) and a radius
(in Angstrom units). Load the hybridization file first if one exists, and
add new hybridizations to it by filling out the fields and clicking on
<b><i>"Add Hybridization to File"</i></b></li>
<li>
<b>Add/Edit Atom:</b> Use this function to modify the <a href=
"somo-2.png">atom table</a>. In this file you need to list all
atom details that will be used for the definitions of all residues. Each
atom requires a name, a hybridization, a molecular weight and a radius (in
Angstrom units). The latter two properties are automatically defined once
the proper hybrydization is chosen from the <a href="somo-1.png">hybridization
table</a>.

Load the hybridization file first, then the atom file if one exists, and
add new atoms to it by filling out the fields and clicking on
<b><i>Add Atom to File</i></b>. You can also delete an atom from
the file.</li>
<li>
<b>Add/Edit Residue:</b> Use this function to modify the <a href=
"somo-residue-0.png">residue table</a>. The use of this module is described in
<a href="somo_residue.html">this help file</a>.

<td align=justify>
In this section you can set all options for different steps in the program.
These options are saved in a system wide config file <pre>
$ULTRASCAN/etc/somo.config</pre> Every time you close the SOMO program,
the currently defined options will be saved in <pre>
$HOME/ultrascan/etc/somo.config</pre>
where they will be reloaded from upon startup.
<ul>
<li>
<b>ASA Calculation:</b> Use this function to modify the options for
the accessible surface area calculation, which can be done with two
alternative methods, SurfRace (Tsodikov OV, Record MT Jr, Sergeev YV.
Novel computer program for fast exact calculation of accessible and
molecular surface areas and average surface curvature.  J. Comput. Chem.
23:600-609, 2002) or ASAB1 (based on Lee B, Richard FM. The interpretation
of protein structures: estimation of static accessibility. J. Mol. Biol.
55:379-400, 1971). The second method is also employed for optionally
re-checking the accessibility of the beads in the final model. A detailed
description of this module can be found <a href=somo_asa.html>here</a>.

<li>
<b>Overlap Reduction:</b> This module allows you to change the options
and handle the various issues related to bead overlap elimination.
A detailed description of this module can be found <a
href=somo_overlap.html>here</a>.

<li>
<b>Hydrodynamic Calculations:</b> This module allows you to change
the options for calculating the hydrodynamic parameters from the bead
models. A detailed description of this module can be found <a
href=somo_results.html>here</a>.

<li>
<b>Miscellaneous Options:</b> This module allows you to either automatically
compute from the composition or manually enter the partial specific volume
of your molecule, and to define the volume used for the hydration water
molecules (water of hydration has different properties than "bulk" water).
A detailed description of this module can be found <a href=somo_misc.html>
here</a>.

<li>
<b>Bead Model Output:</b> This module allows you to control the options for
saving the model(s) in a file. A detailed description of this module can be
found <a href=somo_bead_output.html>here</a>.

<li>
<b>Grid Functions (AtoB):</b> This module allows you to change the options
to be used during the bead model generation with the grid function (based on
the original program AtoB (Byron O. Construction of hydrodynamic bead models
from high-resolution X-ray crystallographic or nuclear magnetic resonance data.
Biophys. J. 72:408-415, 1997). The Grid module accepts as input either PDB files
or previously-generated bead models. A detailed description of this module can
be found <a href=somo_grid.html>here</a>.

<li>
<b>Load Configuration:</b> This button allows you to retrieve a particular
set of options previously saved in a user-specified configuration file (see below).

<li>
<b>Save Current Configuration:</b> This button allows you to save the currently
selected options for all modules in a user-specified configuration file different
from the standard one in which all current parameters are saved when exiting from
the program.

<li>
<b>Reset to Default Options:</b> Click on this button to reset all
options to default values. When exiting just after clicking on this
button will reset the standard configuration file as well to default options.

These functions control the execution of the SOMO program, whose progress is
recorded in the right-side main window. The first step is to select a lookup table
by clicking on <i><b>Select Lookup Table</b></i> (default: <i>somo.residue</i>).
You can create multiple lookup tables for different conditions. The lookup table
needs to contain all atoms and residues defined in your molecule to be loaded in
the next step. By default, SOMO will automatically load the last used <i>*.residue</i> table.
As soon as the lookup table has been successfully loaded, the <i><b>Load PDB File</b></i>
button will become active and you can load a PDB structure file from
NMR or X-ray crystallography experiments. Selecting a PBD file will also
automatically call the molecular visualization program <i>RasMol</i> (Sayle RA, Milner-
White EJ. RasMol: biomolecular graphics for all. Trends Biochem. Sci. 20:374-376,
1995) which will display the structure(s) in a pop-up window. <i>RasMol</i>
needs to be installed in <pre><b>$ULTRASCAN/bin</b></pre> for 32 bit
machines, and <pre><b>$ULTRASCAN/bin64</b></pre> for 64 bit platforms.
You can get a copy of <i>RasMol</i> from <a href="http://www.umass.edu/microbio/rasmol/">
http://www.umass.edu/microbio/rasmol/</a> or from <a href="http://openrasmol.org/#Software">
http://openrasmol.org/#Software</a>.<p>
The PDB file can contain multiple models and if so, multiple models will be displayed by
<i>RasMol</i> and in the list box. In this case, you can select just a single model,
or multiple models by holding the crtl key while clicking on the models' names (crtl-A selects
all models). If multiple models are selected, all subsequent operations
are carried out sequentially on the selected models. Once one or multiple
models are selected, the <i><b>Build SOMO Bead Model</b></i> and <i><b>Build
Grid Bead Model</b></i> buttons will become active, offering two alternative
ways of generating a bead model based on the settings selected
above. Once bead model(s) generation is completed, the progress bar will be at 100% and the bead model(s) can be visualized with <i>RasMol</i> by clicking on <i><b>Visualize Bead Model</b></i>.
The results of the ASA computations can also be visualized in a pop-up window by clicking
on the <i><b>Show ASA Results</b></i> button. Alternatively, you can skip all of
these steps and load a previously generated bead model by clicking on <i><b>Load Bead Model File</b></i> from the menu. In this case, and if the model was generated/saved in the SOMO
format, the various settings/parameters used in model generation will be displayed in
the right-side main window. The hydrodynamic parameters can be then determined by clicking on <i><b>Calculate Hydrodynamics</b></i>. A partial list of parameters can be seen in
a pop-up window as soon as the calculations are completed by clicking on <i><b>Show Hydrodynamic Calculations</b></i>. A full list of all the parameters is also available as a text file,
which can be opened from the results' pop-up window. Operations can be halted at any moment by
clicking on the <i><b>Stop</b></i> button. To avoid inadvertendly loosing data, the
<i><b>Close</b></i> button will not immediately close SOMO, but confirmation will be 
required in a pop-up window.
