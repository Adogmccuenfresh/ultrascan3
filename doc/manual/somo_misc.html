In this module, you can set some options affecting both the model building and
the hydrodynamic computations stages. The <b>Calculate vbar</b> checkbox
allows the computation of the <i>partial specific volume (vbar)</i> in standard
conditions (water @ 20°C) of the structure from its composition, using the
residues' values stored in the <a href= "somo-residue-0.png">residue table</a>
(default: <b>active</b>). Alternatively, a <i>vbar</i> value (either computed by
other means or measured) can be entered in the <i><b>Enter a vbar value (cm^3/g)</b></i>
field. If a significant number of non-coded or incomplete residues are skipped when
parsing the PDB file, the computed <i>vbar</i> could be not correct; in this case,
entering an experimental value will be the best option.  The <b>Select vbar</b>
button will instead load a <i>vbar</i> value  calculated from  protein sequence by using
the <a href=vbar.html>UltraScan vbar calculation routine</a>.
<br>The <i><b>Hydration Water Vol. (A^3)</b></i> field sets the volume of the water
of hydration molecules, which has been found (Gerstein and Chothia, Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci. USA 93:10167-10172, 1996) to be on average 24.5 A<sup>3</sup>,
different from that of either bulk (29.7 A<sup>3</sup>) or isolated (11.5
A<sup>3</sup>) water molecules (default: <b>24.041 A<sup>3</sup></b>). <br>
In the <b>Average Parameters for Automatic Bead Builder:</b> submenu contains a
series of fields governing the <i>average parameters</i> that will be used by the
<i>Automatic Bead Builder</i> routine when this option is selected (see
<a href=somo_pdb_parsing.html>here</a>) for either non-coded residues and/or for
coded residues with missing atoms.<br> 

<ul>
<li>
<b><i>Average atomic radius (A):</i></b>. This is the radius used by the ASA routines
(see <a href=somo_asa.html>here</a>) to compute the <i>accessible surface area</i>
of the non-coded residue. The <b>default</b> value <b>(1.7 A)</b>  was derived by averaging
the atomic radii present in the current (April 2009) version of the default <i>somo.atom</i>
table.

<li>
<b><i>Average atomic mass (Da):</i></b>. This is an average atomic mass for atoms within
non-coded residues used in the computation of the total mass of the model. The <b>default</b>
value <b>(16 Da)</b> was derived by averaging the atomic masses present in the current (April 2009) version of the default <i>somo.atom</i> table. In any case, we strongly suggest to enter a global value in the <i>Total Mass of Model</i> field in the <a href=somo_hydro.html><b><i>SOMO Hydrodynamic
Calculation Options</i></b></a> panel when dealing with structures containing non-coded
residues.


<li>
<b><i>Average atomic hydration:</i></b>. This value will be multiplied by the number of atoms
present in the non-coded residue to determine an hydration number (which will be rounded to the
next integer). The volume calculated from this hydration number multiplied by the <i> hydration
water volume</i> (see above) will be added to the bead volume (see below) to determine the final
volume of the bead. The <b>default</b> value <b>(0.1)</b>  was derived by averaging the hydration 
number of a bead divided by the number of atoms assigned to it for each bead present in the current (April 2009) version of the default <i>somo.residue</i> table.

<li>
<b><i>Average bead/atom volume:</i></b>. This value will be multiplied by the number of atoms
present in the non-coded residue to determine the anhydrous volume of the bead that will
represent them, to which the volume of the water of hydration will be then added (see above).
The <b>default</b> value <b>(20 A<sup>3</sup>)</b>  was derived by averaging the bead volume 
divided by the number of atoms assigned to it for each bead present in the current (April 2009) version of the default <i>somo.residue</i> table.

<li>
<b><i>Average Residue vbar:</i></b>. This value will be used in the computation of the global 
<i>vbar</i> of the model. The <b>default</b> value <b>(0.72 cm<sup>3</sup>/g)</b> is that of
the average protein. It could be changed when dealing with other kind of biomacromolecules. In
any case, we strongly suggest to enter a global (better if experimental) value for <i>vbar</i> 
in the <b><i>Enter vbar:</i></b> field above when dealing with structures containing non-coded
residues.
